# Trafic du CERN

This is the repository for the project "Trafic au CERN". Our professors are Prof. Bastien Chopard and Prof. Pierre Leone. Our contact at CERN is Frédéric Magnin.

## Environment

The simulation is running on C++. We are both running on Ubuntu and working with Geany.

## Model

We will use the model presented by Bastien Chopard and Alexandre Dupuis in "Networks and Spatial Economics, 3: (2003) 9–21". This is a cellular automata for simulation of traffic.
